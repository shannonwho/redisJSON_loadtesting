# Pre-requisites
python3, pip3, virtualenv, docker, docker-compose

The local deployment needs more than 2GB of memory allocated in Docker preferences (from the system to Docker in general).  Just go into the preferences and make sure there is enough memory.  Otherwise, RS will not be able to create the database.

cloud deployment: gcp credentials file and environment settings

# Enable the admin cli (required)
```python3 -m venv venv```

```. venv/bin/activate```

```docker-composer up .```




# The application:

The REST API is based on RedisJSON module for basic JSON Operations:
- GET
  - by key 
  - by key and fields
  - by key and get subdocuments
- POST
  - Simple JSON with no subdocument
  - Nested JSON with array and subdocument
- PUT
  - Append new object/value into an existing JSON object
  - Increase/Multiplying a numeric item in the JSON



# The locust Test: 

## Main test cases:

- WRITE simple JSON without array and subdocument 
- WRITE complex JSON with array and subdocument 
- READ any JSON objects
- READ specific field within a JSON object 
- SET parts of JSON objects 
- APPEND new items into an array of the JSON objects 
- ... 


## Notes on how Locust do distributed tests:
In general, in Locust, itâ€™s the master who is in charge of things like spawning new locusts (users), collecting and presenting results, running some preparatory tasks, etc. So, it appears like we need some code that runs on the master and will:
get the data from the disk
communicate with the workers, to exchange data


## Understand Locust statistics
1. The relationship between Number of users to simulate Vs Hatch Rate (Users Spawned/Second): 
   You define a number of user (locust) you want to spawn, at a given rate. This gives you control of how fast users flood in. For exemple, 100 user at 5 user/sec, it will take 100/5=20 second to reach 100 user.
   Use this command to adjust the number of workers:

        ``` docker-compose up --scale locust_worker=num_of_workers ```

2. The meaning of Median (ms), Average (ms), Content Size(bytes):
   
   Median, average response time of a given api endpoint, over the entire testing time. Content size is the size of the returned data from the endpoint.
   
Note: if you want to generate your own load pattern that's outside of simply adjusting user and spawned/second, you can customize it yourself - https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/generating-custom-load-shape.html#generating-a-custom-load-shape 

More details about stats are also avaialble on '/stats/requests'


## Other components within the tests: 
- Use faker to generate a user info in json:https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/ 
- For load testing you might want to make one of the requests execute more often than the others, Locust allows you to do it by defining the weight for each task.
